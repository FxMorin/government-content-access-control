                This document defines an OAuth 2.1 profile that enables a government
                authority to enforce age-based and content-based access restrictions
                for online services while preserving user privacy. The protocol
                allows relying parties to request government-defined regulatory
                scopes (such as pornography or social media access) and receive
                cryptographically verifiable eligibility decisions without disclosing
                user identity, exact age, or personally identifiable information.
                The profile constrains OAuth features to prevent abuse, cross-service
                correlation, and unauthorized token issuance.

        <section title="Introduction" anchor="sect-1">
            <t>
                Governments increasingly require online services to restrict access
                to certain categories of content based on the age or legal status of
                users. Existing approaches frequently rely on disclosure of personal
                data, third-party identity providers, or proprietary mechanisms that
                enable tracking across services.
            </t>
            <t>
                This document specifies OAuth 2.1 Government Content Access Control
                (GCAC), an OAuth 2.1 <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-v2-1"/> profile in which a
                government-operated authorization server evaluates user eligibility for regulated content
                categories and issues privacy-preserving attestations to relying
                parties. GCAC is designed to answer narrowly scoped regulatory
                questions (e.g., whether a user may access a category of content)
                while minimizing data disclosure and preventing correlation across
                services.
            </t>
            <t>
                GCAC is not an identity system and MUST NOT be used for
                authentication, user login, or personalization.

            <t>
                GCAC relies on OAuth 2.1 security best practices, including
                authorization code flow, PKCE <xref target="RFC7636"/>, redirect URI allowlists, and strong
                client authentication. General security considerations for OAuth 2.0
                <xref target="RFC6819"/> also apply.
                To further protect the integrity and confidentiality of authorization
                requests, RPs SHOULD use JWT-Secured Authorization Request (JAR)
                <xref target="RFC9101"/>.
                Leaked client identifiers alone do not enable
                token issuance. Tokens are RP-scoped and non-transferable,
                preventing cross-service correlation and replay attacks.

                        <t>The authorization request in OAuth 2.0 described in RFC 6749 utilizes query parameter serialization, which means that authorization request parameters are encoded in the URI of the request and sent through user agents such as web browsers. While it is easy to implement, it means that a) the communication through the user agents is not integrity protected and thus, the parameters can be tainted, b) the source of the communication is not authenticated, and c) the communication through the user agents can be monitored. Because of these weaknesses, several attacks to the protocol have now been put forward.</t>
                        <t>This document introduces the ability to send request parameters in a JSON Web Token (JWT) instead, which allows the request to be signed with JSON Web Signature (JWS) and encrypted with JSON Web Encryption (JWE) so that the integrity, source authentication, and confidentiality properties of the authorization request are attained. The request can be sent by value or by reference.</t>
